Assignment 1(Technology and Information System)

On 28th October 2025, I had the opportunity to attend a talk about Microsoft 365 Copilot at UTM Digital during the UTMDigital Open Day.

From this talk, I knew that the speed of AI integration in our daily live is accelerating.As a student this experience is important for me to understand the ethical and practical implications of AI. 

I am grateful to UTM Digital for organizing this session, as it provided a golden opportunity to make our academic life more productive and innovative.
